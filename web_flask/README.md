## What is a Web Framework?

A web framework is essentially a software platform designed to facilitate web application development, including services, resources, and APIs. Put simply, these frameworks provide developers with tools to create and run web applications without having to code everything from scratch, thereby reducing errors and development time.

Historically, web frameworks emerged to address limitations in early web development, where applications could only be modified by their original creators. Today's landscape is much different, with specialized web languages and frameworks that offer greater flexibility. Modern developers can either select a single comprehensive framework that meets all their project requirements or combine multiple frameworks for enhanced functionality.
